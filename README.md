### Predict the future trend of an asset

Our goal was to predict the future trend of a stock, index fund, and a cryptocurrency: Nvidia, S&P 500, and Bitcoin. It was done by utilizing Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models that was be trained from historical data and produced the future stock trend. To compare actual values from the predicted values in a visual way, we presented the predicted values overlayed with the actual values. In addition, to determine the accuracy of our LSTM models, we utilized various performance metrics such as RMSE and MAPE. Also, we utilized additional indicators such as simple moving average (SMA), Support/Resistance, and Relative strength index (RSI). 

### Fine-tune LLM for Sentiment Analysis

- Finetuned of distilbert-base-uncased on IMDB dataset for sentiment analysis.
- Finetuned Mistral 7b on FinGPT dataset designed to assist with sentiment analysis with QLoRA.

### Exploring Nashville Housing Data

In this project I take raw housing data which is a dump from MSSQL Server, created the required table in PostgreSQL database, imported the csv file and transform it in PostgreSQL to make it more usable for analysis. 

### Web Scraping using OpenWeatherMap API 

In this project we demonstrate how to use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for a specific city and perform EDA on the results 

### Credit Risk Analysis 

In this project, we examine credit risk using logistic regression and various machine learning models applied to the American Express dataset. Our goal is to identify the most effective model for predicting credit card defaults and to pinpoint the key variables influencing credit risk. 

### TV Ad. Performance Analysis 

In this project study advertising and survey data of a client and analyze which networks are the most cost efficient by calculating Cost Per Visitor (CPV), Conversion Rate (CR), and Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) driven by the TV campaign.

### Analyze, Predict Nat_Gas Prices with Time Series

We implement a time series analysis of natural gas prices using various forecasting models like ARIMA SARIMA Model and Exponential Smoothing. Performance metrics are computed to assess their accuracy. A chat function is implemented to allow users to inquire about specific dates.

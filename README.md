## Projects
### Real-Time Stock Prediction Using Hadoop, PySpark, and Kafka

- Developed a real-time stock prediction solution, utilizing Hadoop, PySpark, and Kafka to process large volumes of historical and live stock market data efficiently.
- Implemented a seamless ETL pipeline, reducing data latency by 18% and enabling more responsive technical analysis.
- Provided actionable insights to stakeholders, resulting in improved decision-making in real-time stock investments.

### AI-Powered Financial Analysis Project

- Engineered an AI-driven platform to analyze financial performance for companies like Apple, Tesla, and Microsoft, incorporating a Gemini-powered chatbot for real-time insights.
- Calculated key metrics, including revenue growth and the Assets to Liabilities Ratio, enabling comprehensive financial assessments.
- Integrated an interactive chatbot for instant user queries, enhancing stakeholder engagement through natural language processing.
- Created dynamic visualizations with Plotly to illustrate financial trends, supporting informed decision-making.

### Retail Sales Querying and Optimization

- Developed a relational database from a year’s worth of retail sales data, enabling faster queries and more accurate trend analysis.
- Increased query performance by 49% by implementing indexing and benchmarking techniques, facilitating real-time business insights.
- Conducted detailed analyses of sales trends, helping drive a 15% increase in revenue by optimizing inventory management and marketing strategies.


### Predict the future trend of an asset
- **Goal**: Predict future trends for Nvidia (stock), S&P 500 (index), and Bitcoin (cryptocurrency) using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** models trained on historical data.
- **Visualization**: Predicted trends were overlaid with actual values for visual comparison.
- **Performance Metrics**:  
  - **RMSE**: Measures prediction accuracy (lower is better).
  - **MAPE**: Measures percentage deviation from actual values (lower is better).
- **Additional Indicators**:  
  - **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**
  - **Support/Resistance Levels**
  - **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**

**Key Points**:
- LSTM models predicted trends effectively, and performance was assessed using RMSE and MAPE.
- Technical indicators (SMA, Support/Resistance, RSI) were used alongside LSTM predictions to enhance analysis and improve decision-making.

### Fine-tune LLM for Sentiment Analysis

- Finetuned of distilbert-base-uncased on IMDB dataset for sentiment analysis.
- Finetuned Mistral 7b on FinGPT dataset designed to assist with sentiment analysis with QLoRA.

### Exploring Nashville Housing Data

- In this project I enhanced the Nashville Housing dataset by addressing missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing key variables. 
- Filled in missing `PropertyAddress` values by matching `ParcelID` with existing data.
- Identified and removed duplicate entries based on key fields like `ParcelID`, `SalePrice`, and `PropertyAddress`.
- Converted inconsistent values in the `SoldAsVacant` field and split address columns into structured components.

These enhancements ensure the dataset is cleaner, more accurate, and ready for reliable analysis and predictive modeling, providing a solid foundation for real estate forecasting and better decision-making.  

### Web Scraping using OpenWeatherMap API 

- In this project I demonstrate how to use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for a specific city and perform EDA on the results 

### Credit Risk Analysis 

- Applied logistic regression and machine learning models to predict credit card defaults and identify key risk factors.
- Dataset: American Express dataset (available on Kaggle).
- Loaded data, handled missing values, performed feature engineering, scaled features, and addressed class imbalance using SMOTE.
- Built and evaluated models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, KNN.
- Evaluated models using accuracy, F1-score, and ROC AUC.
- Provided insights into credit risk assessment, demonstrating how machine learning can improve credit default prediction and decision-making for financial institutions.
  
### TV Advertisement Performance Analysis 

- In this project I study advertising and survey data of a client
- Analyze which networks are the most cost efficient by calculating Cost Per Visitor (CPV), Conversion Rate (CR), and Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) driven by the TV campaign.

### Analyze and Predict Natural Gas Prices with Time Series

- I implement a time series analysis of natural gas prices using various forecasting models like ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing and Transformer based time series model TimeGPT.
- Performance metrics are computed to assess their accuracy. A chat function is implemented to allow users to inquire about specific dates.
